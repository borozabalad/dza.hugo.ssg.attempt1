# Introduction {#Bookmark45}

This section deals with the general design of the bCLEARer pipeline to
facilitate transparency. The bCLEARer pipeline is designed as [a
sequence of nested filters]{.inline-comment-marker
ref="fe7e8d04-0550-4374-82d5-3c80a644aa12"} - the pipeline flow. It is
important that this flow is not only transparent, open to inspection,
but also resilient in the face of change. Hence we discuss the general
design principles that will encourage this.

[]{#Bookmark46}

# Design principles {#Bookmark46}

We have found it useful to design the bCLEARer pipeline with a view to
reducing the cost of evolving the pipeline - especially radically
evolving - to take advantage of the opportunities that emerge on the
journey of discovery. There are many well-known principles and
techniques to achieve this. For example, focusing on building in
modularity not only increases maintainability and reusability, but also
refactoring and extensibility. These are well-documented, and we aim to
point to these resources here and in the associated appendices.

However, our focus here is on the less well-documented goal of
facilitating transparency. One core central motivation for this is that
delivering transparent transformations, and so enabling easy inspection,
is a solid basis for improving the value of, as well as enhancing the
trust in, the transformations. The aim is to systematise this
inspection[ so reducing the effort need]{.inline-comment-marker
ref="7f120566-f37c-43de-9160-06e366ed6991"} to develop and maintain it
during the rapid evolution of the pipeline.

In the following sections, we aim to highlight here with some examples
ways we can use the many well-known principles to better achieve our
more focused goals. We start [with a look]{.inline-comment-marker
ref="2b0ba621-7f03-4eb8-b837-e1441875e4f8"} at the general approach to
decomposition, and then look at two principles:

-   separation of transformation concerns

-   immutability and idempotence

There is a significant literature on these principles, so here we
outline them and give references for further reading in the associated
appendices.

## General approach to decomposition {#Bookmark47}

In previous sections, we have visualised the modular structure of
pipeline flow in terms of a flowchart to provide a picture of its
structure. However, we need a different approach to decomposing it into
filters. To reinforce this point, consider David L. Parnas's classic
Communications of the ACM paper *On the Criteria To Be Used in
Decomposing Systems into Modules* (1972) where he makes this point,
proposing an alternative to simple flowchart decomposition saying:

"We have tried to demonstrate by these examples that it is almost always
incorrect to begin the decomposition of a system into modules on the
basis of a flowchart. We propose instead that one begins with a list of
difficult design decisions or design decisions which are likely to
change. Each module is then designed to hide such a decision from the
others."

In the case of bCLEARer, the design decisions should consider, at the
least, the various different kinds of information transformation. At the
lowest level, the breakdown should end up with bUnits that deal with a
single transformation - bUnits should not handle more than one
transformation. This could be regarded as a 'single-transformation
principle' - alluding to the single-responsibility principle. For more
details see: [Appendix - Single-transformation (responsibility)
principle
(STP)](https://borocvi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SB/pages/5772902401 "https://borocvi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SB/pages/5772902401"){linked-resource-id="5772902401"
linked-resource-version="8" linked-resource-type="page"}.

[]{#Bookmark48}

## Principle: separation of transformation concerns {#Bookmark48}

The separation of concerns (described in more detail in the Appendix
([TtDT - Report - Appendix - separation of concerns
principle](page5772804106.html#Bookmark99 "TtDT - Report - Appendix - separation of concerns principle"){linked-resource-id="5772804106"
linked-resource-version="1" linked-resource-type="page"}) is similar in
many respects to single-transformation principle (see: [Appendix -
Single-transformation (responsibility) principle
(STP)](https://borocvi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SB/pages/5772902401 "https://borocvi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SB/pages/5772902401"){linked-resource-id="5772902401"
linked-resource-version="8" linked-resource-type="page"}). From a
concerns perspective, the different types of transformation can be seen
as different concerns, and so should be separated. As a first stage,
this leads to base bUnits with a single concern. This enables cleaner
tracing of transformations, as it also separates out the contributors to
the transformation.

This can lead to a significant number of base Units. When organising
these base bUnits into larger modules it is useful to consider
principles of cohesion and coupling (there are more details on this in
[TtDT - Report - Appendix - cohesion and
coupling](page5772804097.html#Bookmark97 "TtDT - Report - Appendix - cohesion and coupling"){linked-resource-id="5772804097"
linked-resource-version="4" linked-resource-type="page"}).

Cohesion is a measure of [functional ]{.inline-comment-marker
ref="8cf28bb0-f7d6-43d7-aff2-5959e93468f9"}closeness - and a good
modular design will have high cohesion where the [functional
]{.inline-comment-marker
ref="4448be20-3f88-404c-8354-c62f4eadf689"}closeness is high inside the
modules and low outside. Coupling is a measure of interdependence. A
good modular design will have low coupling between modules and higher
coupling inside the module. This is illustrated visually in the figure
below.\

## Principle: immutability and idempotence {#Bookmark49}

Immutability and idempotence are about how transformations are handled.
Immutable data's content cannot be modified after it is created. An
idempotent process can be run multiple times with the same input without
changing the output. [The pipeline architecture promotes idempotent
processes (filters) and immutable datasets.]{.inline-comment-marker
ref="636b6f27-c430-4678-8cc9-b01cea4bcb24"}

We can illustrate this by comparing interactive and batch processing.
The data updated by interactive processing is typically not immutable -
the process changes [its ]{.inline-comment-marker
ref="cea9a594-1cb8-49ce-b310-18f53f0750b7"}content. Whereas the data
created by batch processing - the common pipeline process - is typically
immutable. This is shown in the graphic below.

[![](/Users/terraire/Downloads/TtDT/media/img_43.png){.confluence-embedded-image
.image-center width="544"
height="148"}]{.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .image-center-wrapper
.confluence-embedded-manual-size}

So, adopting immutable data and idempotent processes (filters) is a
natural choice for a pipeline architecture. And adopting it has several
advantages. The immutability simplifies auditability, making
transformations easier to track. The idempotence makes rerunning the
processes safer and simpler. For more on these topics see the appendix:
[TtDT - Report - Appendix - immutability and idempotence
principle](page5772869633.html#Bookmark101 "TtDT - Report - Appendix - immutability and idempotence principle"){linked-resource-id="5772869633"
linked-resource-version="2" linked-resource-type="page"}.
